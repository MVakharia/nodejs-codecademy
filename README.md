# Nodejs projects

### A repository for Node.js projects I've completed as part of the Full-Stack engineer course on Codecademy and in my spare time. 

## Study topics:

- The ```process``` keyword.
- The 6 different types of server: file server, database server, web server, mail server, application server, and proxy server. 
- Enter the Node REPL and tinker with it.
- Run a program from the terminal using ```node myProgram.js```.
